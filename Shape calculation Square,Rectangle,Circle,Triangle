# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a = int(input())          
l = int(input())          
w = int(input())         
r = int(input())          
d = int(input())      
s = int(input())      
e= int(input())      
ps = 4 * a
pr = 2 * (l + w)
pc= 2 * 3.141 * r
pt = d + s + e
print(f"Perimeter of Square:{ps}")
print(f"Perimeter of Rectangle:{pr}")
print(f"Perimeter of Circle:{pc:.2f}")
print(f"Perimeter of Triangle:{pt}")
